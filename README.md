# GitHub Documentation Repository <!-- omit in toc -->

Welcome to the official GitHub Documentation repository. This repository contains both the source files in Markdown and the code that powers [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com), the home of comprehensive and up-to-date GitHub documentation.

The GitHub Documentation team actively collaborates on pre-production content within a private repository, which is routinely synchronized with this public repository.
